        "  - Python is a high level, interpreted language that is simple and easy. It was developed by Guido Van Rossum. It is an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Reasons why python is popular:\n",
        "       * It is simple because it contains statements that appears like english sentences.\n",
        "       * It is easy to learn as it uses simple structure.\n",
        "       * Python is free to use and its source code can be modified and shared.\n",
        "       * Python programs give the same output on any computer.\n",
        "       * Python also has huge standard library that help us do works easily.\n",
        "    \n",
        "-------------\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in python?\n",
        "  - An interpreter in python is a program that reads and executes the code line by line. By doing this it makes the development and debugging faster as compared to compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "     print(\"Hello\")\n",
        "\n",
        "     print(\"world\")\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here the interpreter will run print(\"Hello\") first and in other line print(\"World\") like one line at a time.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in python are special reserved words that has special meaning. These keywords cannot be used as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example: if, else, while, for, def, True, False etc..\n",

        "4. Can Keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in python. Because keywords in python has special meanings and using them as variable names can cause a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "        for = 10\n",

        "  - Mutability in python means whether the value of an object can be changed after it is being created. If it can be changed then it is known as mutable. It it cannot be changed then it is known as immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Mutable: List, dictionary\n",

        "    Immutable: String,tuple\n",

        "----\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - List are designed in such a way that it is used to store data that can change, so they are mutable, meaning that we can add, remove or change elements after its created.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tuples are desined in such a way that it is used to staore that data that cannot be changed(it is fixed), so they are immutable, meaning the elements cannot be changed after its created.\n",

        "    Example:\n",

        "  - The \"==\" operator in python is used to compare the values of two objects. It returns True if all the values of both objects are the same, even if they are located at different memory locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The \"is\" operator in python is used to check whether two variables refers to same object in memory. It returns True if both variables point to same memory location, not just equal values.\n",

        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators in python are used to combine the logical conditions of statements. They operate on boolean values and produce boolean results (True or False).\n",
        "\n",
        "    There are three logical operators in python. They are:\n",
        "\n",

        "  - Type casting in python means converting one data type to another data type. It allows you to change like converting a string to an integer, or an integer to a float etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Some of the type casting in python are:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * int() - to convert to integer.\n",
        "    * float() - to convert to float.\n",

        "    * bool() - to convert to boolean.\n",

        "  - Implicit type casting in python means it automatically converts one data type to another data type, without the programmer needing to write any code.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example:\n",
        "\n",
